# This project has been developed to help you utilize the statistics of Hanbot users optimally.
# Win rates, pick rates, and overall rates of champions are calculated, allowing you to sort them as you wish, and the most popular shard of the character is also listed.

# Don't forget to review how much knowledge you have about a champion before selecting them.
# And keep in mind that the most popular shard may not always be the best option.
